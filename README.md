# VSCode DLS

## Features

Features are provided by DLS's dependencies: [DCD](http://dcd.dub.pm), [DFMT](http://dfmt.dub.pm) (and [D-Scanner](http://dscanner.dub.pm) in the future).
Look [here](https://github.com/LaurentTreguier/dls) for an up-to-date list of features currently supported.
For now few features are implemented, but the server will propose updates as new features come.

## Requirements

If dub is installed, DLS will be fetched and built automatically.
If dub is not installed, DLS must be manually installed and its path must be set in VSCode's configuration (`d.dlsPath`).
