# VSCode DLS

## Features

Features are provided by DLS's dependencies.
Look [here](https://github.com/LaurentTreguier/dls) for an up-to-date list of features currently supported.

## Requirements

If dub is installed, DLS will be fetched and built automatically.
If dub is not installed, DLS must be manually installed and its path must be set in VSCode's configuration (`d.dlsPath`).
