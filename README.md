# VSCode DLS

## Features

Features are provided by DLS's dependencies: [DCD](http://dcd.dub.pm), [DFMT](http://dfmt.dub.pm) (and [D-Scanner](http://dscanner.dub.pm) in the future).
Look [here](https://github.com/LaurentTreguier/dls) for an up-to-date list of features currently supported.
For now few features are implemented, but the server will offer updates as new features come.

## Requirements

Dub should be installed to fetch and build DLS's bootstrap utility, which will then install DLS itself.
